**Herschel Project**

**Building a native x86\-64 compiler for BlackBox Component Builder**

****

So, the goal of this project is to produce a native x86\-64 compiler for the BlackBox Component Builder\.



**Our main values:**

\* **identity**: the Component Pascal language is awesome; it has to be preserved "AS IS", without any changes

\* **continuity**: we are pretty happy with the existing CP2 compiler, so we are building on it's foundation\.

**Why Herschel?**

William Herschel is the British astronomer \(as well as musician\) who discovered **Oberon**, a satellite of **Uranus**\. The space probe **Voyager** 2 was passing Oberon in January of 1986 and made several photographs of it\. Around that time, Nicklaus **Wirth** was developing the programming language and operating system; he was impressed with the engineering success behind Voyager 2 and called the language and the system afther the satellite\. In 1996, a successor of Oberon was called **Component** **Pascal**\. It is the language we love, use and aim to translate\.

William Herschel saw beyond his contemporaries; he did so in part because he was using his own hand\-made tools \- telescopes with his own hand\-made mirrors\. They say he would sometimes work on polishing a mirror for as long as 16 hours\. So, as you can see, tools matter \- that's why we use Component Pascal\.
