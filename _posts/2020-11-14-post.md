title: First word to the world
---


After weeks of hard work \(understanding and adapting the OCF format, then hacking the ELF format\), I have got Herschel to produce a module that imports a host library \(\.so\) and then to link it into an ELF executable\. Upon invocation, it is linked \(by the operating system\) to the libraries, after which it prints it's first 3\-letter word \- Herschel's first word to the world\.

The example below calls libc's *puts\(\) *function\. Calling an external library implies using the appropriate calling convention \- in this case, System V ABI calling convention\. For those of our readers who are not in the know \- it is WAY more complicated from a compiler writer's perspective than the good old \[ccall\] convention, and CP2's native convention\. I had to implement parts of it\.

As you can see in the example below, I also had to implement \(partially\) the \[code\] procedures in order to exit\(\) from the host os process gracefully \- it is done thru an interrupt call\.

Another major bulk of work I had to do \- the OCF file format\. Herschel now outputs OCF files; they cannot be read by the 32bit BlackBox because I had to add two fields to the format to provide support for 64\-bit System V ABI\. At first it seemed rather compilcated, but now, 'on the other side of the hill', I would say OCF is reasonable, purpose\-driven, resource\-savvy, beautifull and minimalistic\. To learn and adapt it, I produced an OCF importer \- somewhat more detailed than the one shipped with BlackBox\. One feature I'm particularly happy with is decoding variable and procedure names in the disassembly of the module text\.

Quite a mountain of work since the last status update\! Now \- on to PE format, so that our Windows\-based users could write their own first words in 64\-bit BlackBox\!

Thank you to the donors who help do this work\. 

If you're interested in having a 64\-bit CP compiler and BlackBox, get invested in it as well \- consider donating to the project in order to support it\.
