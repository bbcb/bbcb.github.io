\* Most language features save type extension and pointers handling implemented\.

\* A downloadable package for Windows, [here](https://github.com/adimetrius/Herschel/releases), easy to run and try out Herschel features\.

\* The binder tool now capable of producing a DLL out of an OCF module \(that is, one compiled Component Pascal module\)

\* Compiler capable of adhering to Microsoft calling convention \(mark your procedures with \[ms64\] sysflag\)

\* Produced DLL \(with some language features\) tested successfully in Excel VBA environment



For further compiler development, an improved testing environment is necessary \(at least desireable\) that could link a tested module with a proto\-kernel \- a trivial run\-time environment that provides the NEW procedure implementation\. After some consideration, we have decided to continue building on the A2 testing environment\. Now, a trivial linking module loader has been implemented that runs in A2/Linux64\. With this, we will be working on type extension, dynamic variables and pointer handling\.



As side effects:

\* Further improvements in the OCF decoder, making decoded OCF modules easier to understand and proof\-read\.

\* Feeling VERY uncomfortable with the A2 user experience, built a simple tool that enables A2 source  editing in BlackBox \(including use of all text attributes\), compilation in A2's Fox compiler, with error messages brought back into convenient BlackBox error markers\.
