After a 4\-month break \(which was used to work on BlackBox 2\.0\) I went back to Herschel and picked it up where I left it off \- at NEW\.

For NEW to work, the run\-time environment has to provide some metainformation\. In BB/CP, this metaiformation is in the form of type descriptors whose addresses can be obtained with SYSTEM\.TYP\(T\), as well as many other bits and pieces defined in Kernel \(Kernel\.Type, \.ObjDesc, \.Directory, \.Module, etc\.\)\. Also, NEW\(RecPtr\) is translated into a call for PROCEDURE Kernel\.NewRec\(descriptor: ADDRESS\): ADDRESS\.

It turns out this metainformation, including type descriptors, is formed by the compiler and written out directly into the OCF format\. The module loader then loads the OCF format, applies various fixups \- and voila, the metainformation is ready for the Kernel to use\.

Because it contains a lot of pointers, and pointer size grows from 4 to 8 bytes, a lot of amendments had to be applied to the compiler and some to the module loader \(in the testing environment\)\.

At this time, SYSTEM\.TYP\(T\) has been implemented, and a test has been developed that demonstrates that record type descriptors, field directories and applicable fixups work well in the complier, in the OCF format and in the module loader\.

NEW is on the way\.
