title: 2021 Update
---


Allrighdee, there's alot of news since the last update\.

\* ELF \(Linux\) and PE \(Windows\) executables are produced from 1 module, allowing host system binding \(calls to host os\)\. This enables 'Hello world' applications on both host platforms\. Exciting stuff\!

\* This implies the two host calling conventions \(SysV and MS x64\) have been implemented as well\. This is a huge amount of work\!

\* Both sides of the calling conventions have been implemented \- this means that you can call a procedure of the convention AND write your own procedures of those conventions\. This is necessary for host callback procedures in BlackBox \- and for clients that want to make, say, DLLs in BlackBox with procedures that can be called by C/C\+\+/arbitrary programs\.

\* PE DLLs can be made of 1 module\. Lots of work here\!

\* IF, WHILE, REPEAT, RETURN, FOR implemented\. This was maybe one of the simplest parts of the work done\.

\* REAL and SHORTREAL arythmetic added\. It uses the inherited x87 implementation\. Limited use of XMM unit is implemented to allow interaction with MS x64 calling convention\.



As a side\-effect:

\* Improved OCF decoder and disassembler, using some advice from user X512\.

\* A module providing convenient scanners for the OCF format is under construction\. May be of use in other system\-level programs\.
