AS of today, September 9th:

\* The code generator is up and running

\* Global variables can be addressed

\* Module body \(BEGIN section of a module\) can be compiled

\* The assignment operator works \(for a limited number of basic types\)

\* The basic types that are implemented are: BYTE SHORTINT INTEGER LONGINT CHAR SHORTCHAR BOOLEAN SET

\* Assignments of the form var := literal/var are implemented for the aforementioned types

\* Safe type casts with CHR ORD and unsafe casts SYSTEM\.VAL are implemented for the aforementioned types

\* All of the above features coverd with tests

\* Two kinds of standards \(correct test responses\) for the code generator are produced: the actual generated machine text standards and the field test standards\. A field test standard is the values of global variables that the generated code 'leaves'\.

\* A testing infrastructure for the code generator is implemented

\* The CG tester consisting of an HTTP server receiving requests and a primitive loader actually executing generated 64\-bit code is implemented in A2 \- the Oberon\-based active objects operating system

\* The testing panel \(front\-end\) in BB has been updated to accomodate now both front\-end and back\-end tests and standards\.

\* The test base now has about 100 test\.
