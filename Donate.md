**New donations in the last month:**

In December, we have received €100 from Christian Hörmann, ₽5000 from Ivan Denisov, and ₽2222 from Comdiv on Jan 1\. Deeply grateful to our donors\!

Also, Mobatec's 6\-month committment has been fulfilled, so we are looking and asking for more donations, potentially recurring\. 





At the time, Adimetrius is the lead, senior, mid and jun in this project\. He works on it day, and sometimes night, as a volunteer, full of enthusiasm\.

Currently, we have 6 donating supporters: Mathieu Westerweele from Mobatec, NL, two undisclosed supporters and Ivan Denisov from Kraysnoyarsk, RU\.
